#### Band Theory

A useful way to visualize the distinction between conductors(metal)l, insulators and semiconductors is to plot out their energies for electrons within the material. Rather than having distinct energies, as within the case of free atoms, the energy states which are available form bands.

Crucial to the conductivity method is whether or not the electrons are inside the conductivity band. In insulators, the electrons inside the valence band are separated by  a large gap from the conduction band, in conductors like metals the valence band overlaps the conduction band, and in semiconductors, there is a very little enough gap between the valence and conduction bands that thermal or totally different excitations can bridge the gap.

With such a small gap, the presence of a less proportion of a doping material can increase conduction dramatically. A vital parameter inside the band theory is that of the Fermi level, the highest of the accessible electron energy levels at lower temperatures. The position of the Fermi level in relevance to the conductivity band might be important to the place confidence in crucial electrical properties.

#### Conduction Band

The conduction band is the band of electron orbitals that electrons can bounce up into from the valence band when energized. At the point when the electrons are in these orbitals, they have enough energy to move freely in the material. This movement of electrons makes an electric current flow. The valence band is the furthest electron orbital of a particle of a particular material that electrons involve.

The energy distinction between the highest occupied energy state of the valence band and the least abandoned condition of the conduction band is known as the bandgap and is demonstrative of the electrical conductivity of a material. An enormous bandgap implies that a great deal of vitality is required to energize valence electrons to the conduction band. Then again, when the valence band and conduction band cover as they do in metals, electrons can promptly bounce between the two groups which means the material is profoundly conductive.

The electrons in this energy band can expand their energies by going to higher energy levels inside the band when an electric field is applied to quicken them or when the temperature of the crystal is increased. These electrons are called conduction electrons.

Here are some of the differences between a valence band and conduction band.
